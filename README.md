# Task 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris Dataset  

## Objective  
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset to understand its structure, summarize it, and visualize key patterns.  

## Dataset  
- **Name:** Iris Dataset  
- **Rows & Columns:** 150 × 5  
- **Features:** Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width  
- **Target:** Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)  

## Steps Performed  
1. Imported libraries (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib).  
2. Loaded the dataset from Seaborn.  
3. Checked shape, datatypes, and summary statistics.  
4. Verified missing values (none).  
5. Created visualizations:  
   - Histogram of features  
   - Pairplot (feature relationships)  
   - Correlation heatmap  
   - Boxplot grouped by species  

## Insights  
- No missing values were present.  
- Petal length and petal width are highly correlated.  
- Setosa flowers are distinctly smaller in petal size.  
- Versicolor and Virginica overlap slightly but still show patterns.  

## Conclusion  
EDA revealed important patterns in the dataset. This analysis helps in building machine learning models for classification.
